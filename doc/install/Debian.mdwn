## Debian testing or unstable

Debian unstable and testing are usually fairly up to date, so this should be enough:

	sudo apt install git-annex

## Standalone backports for all releases

If the version shipped with Debian is too old, 
the [NeuroDebian team](http://neuro.debian.net/) provides a
[standalone build package](http://neuro.debian.net/pkgs/git-annex-standalone.html)
that is regularly updated and that should work across all releases of
Debian.

## Debian 8.0 "jessie"

	sudo apt install git-annex

There is also a backport for jessie, even though it is [often out of date](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=760787).

Follow the instructions to [enable backports](http://backports.debian.org/Instructions/).

	sudo apt -t jessie-backports install git-annex

## Debian 7.0 "wheezy":

	sudo apt-get install git-annex

Note: This version does not include support for the [[assistant]].
A backport is available with the assistant and other new features.

Follow the instructions to [enable backports](http://backports.debian.org/Instructions/).

	sudo apt-get -t wheezy-backports install git-annex

## Debian 6.0 "squeeze"

Follow the instructions to [enable backports](http://backports.debian.org/Instructions/).

	sudo apt-get -t squeeze-backports install git-annex
