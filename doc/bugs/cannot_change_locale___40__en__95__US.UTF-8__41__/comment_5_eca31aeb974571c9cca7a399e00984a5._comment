This bug does not want to die.

The current standalone build (`6.20161211-gc3ab3c668`) has been compiled with GHC 8 but when I launch `runshell`, I still see that `LOCPATH` is set and the character encoding is messed up.

I deduced the version of GHC used to compile git-annex with `strings ./shimmed/git-annex/git-annex | grep 'GHC [0-9]'`.
