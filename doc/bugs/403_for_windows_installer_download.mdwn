### Please describe the problem.
As of Nov 2, 2016 1:30AM EST, no Windows installer is to be found in https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/windows/current/. Accessing .exe URI directly yields a 403 error.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
See https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/windows/current/.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
N/A

### Please provide any additional information below.

# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log


# End of transcript or log.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
Yes! Worked like a charm on my Mac.
