### Please describe the problem.
fsck doesn't not update the inventory for external special remotes

This is perhaps the same behavior on all special remotes, but I have not verified it.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Run fsck or fsck -F on a special remote on which the file has been deleted outside of git-annex's knowledge.  The file will fail the existence check, but not update the inventory (i.e. git-annex-whereis/git-annex-list still thinks the file might reside on that remote).

### Why I care about this problem
Some files in my external special remote got removed outside of git-annex's knowledge. I would like to copy back in the files that are missing, but I am having a hard time doing so.  git-annex-copy also notices that the file fails the existence check, but doesn't bother trying to re-upload the file.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
git-annex is fantastic!  It is the only program that I trust to store my most precious files.  If there is another way to get git-annex to update its inventory for files removed in special remotes I will gladly try it!  Keep up the good work!
