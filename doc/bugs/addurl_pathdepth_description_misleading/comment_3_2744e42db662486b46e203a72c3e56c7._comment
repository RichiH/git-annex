Seems to work as described here:

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/r>rm localhost__joey_blog_index.html 
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/r>git annex addurl --pathdepth 2 http://localhost/~joey/blog/index.html
	addurl blog/index.html (downloading http://localhost/~joey/blog/index.html ...) 
	/home/joey/tmp/r/ 100%[===========>]  40.70K  --.-KB/s    in 0s      
	ok
	(recording state in git...)
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/r>ls
	blog/
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/r>ls blog
	index.html

It would probably help if you can provide a test case where it does not work
as described.
