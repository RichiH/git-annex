I really don't know what to say. I can't even figure out which computer I updated git-annex on to test if it was still happening.. let alone reproduce it anymore. It does work fine.

I'm so sorry to bother you with this, I've done something stupid! This is exactly why you ask for a transcript of bugs occurring. (Feel free to use this as an example for why you ask for them, so some good can come of it at least..).
