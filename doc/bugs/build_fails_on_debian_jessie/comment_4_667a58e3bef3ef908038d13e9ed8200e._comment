Re shakespeare, IIRC the dependency on version 2.0 was only needed
in order to remove a dependency on hamlet, which got removed upstream.
So if you add back the dependency on hamlet, it should
build with the older version of shakespeare.

See git commit 2989cdfe3ed7524c00d16b21e8af9773c37497ff.
Basically, you want to revert that commit.

Sorry about this farce; I tragically can't see a way to express
the actual dependency situation in git-annex.cabal and debian/control ..
