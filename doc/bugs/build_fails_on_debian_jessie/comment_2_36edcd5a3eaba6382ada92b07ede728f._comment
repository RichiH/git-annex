Got round to this eventually - build disk-space-free and mountpoints easily enough but then got into dependency hell over the shakespeare package: debian build process wants a later version than present in jessie, but won't build the stretch version against the jessie haskell packages.  

I haven't got much experience of haskell, especially under debian build: is there a way out of this?
