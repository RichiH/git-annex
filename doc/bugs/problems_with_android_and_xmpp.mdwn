### Please describe the problem.
When trying to sync my android phone with my linux laptop using the git annex assistant and XMPP no files are transferred.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
1) setup git annex via webapp on laptop:

* local annex

* remote annex via ssh with shared encryption (tried two different servers, one with and one without git-annex installed)

* share with my devices using jabber.me account

2) setup git annex via webapp on android:

* local annex in /sdcard/annex (fuse filesystem without symlink support)

* share with my devices using jabber.me account

* ssh remote is automatically added via XMPP

3) add files to annex on linux, they get uploaded to the ssh remote

4) wait forever for any files from linux to download to phone

5) add files to annex on phone, they get uploaded to the ssh remote

4) wait forever for any files from phone to download to linux

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
Ubunut Linux 12.04 with git-annex version:

* 5.20140127.1 (from PPA)

Android 4.2 (rooted) tried with git-annex versions:

* 5.20140209 (from http://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/android/current/4.0/)

* 5.20140211-g556cfeb (from autobuilds)

### Please provide any additional information below.
full logs:

(these do not show the uploads to the ssh remote, because I restarted to get clean and short logs, but the files are on the server and can be dropped and restored on the linux side manually)
