### Please describe the problem.
When I do git annex add on a directory with a filename that include a "?"
I get an error:
git-annex: unknown response from git cat-file ("HEAD:./Home/wc/Icon missing","HEAD:./Home/wc/Icon\r")
CallStack (from HasCallStack):
  error, called at ./Git/CatFile.hs:86:48 in main:Git.CatFile

where the file here was called "Icon?"

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
mkdir test

cd test

git init

git annex init "test"

cp ~/Desktop/Icon? .

ls

Icon?

git annex add .

 git-annex: unknown response from git cat-file ("HEAD:./Icon missing","HEAD:./Icon\r")

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
