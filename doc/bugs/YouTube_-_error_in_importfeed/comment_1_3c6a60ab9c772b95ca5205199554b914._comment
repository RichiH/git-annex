It's somewhat misleading that it complains there are no enclosures in the
feed. While importfeed mostly downloads only enclosures in podcast feeds,
it also checks link tags, which this feed contains, to see if quvi supports
downloading content from them. Quvi does support the links in this feed,
so it should work despite there being no enclosures.

I've reproduced it not working, and it seems that the problem is this is
not quite a valid Atom feed, and the feed parsing library is failing to
parse it. Perhaps that can be improved; I filed a bug here
