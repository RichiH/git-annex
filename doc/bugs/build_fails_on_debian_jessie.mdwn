### Please describe the problem.

Can't build on debian jessie using "make" - "apt-get build-dep git-annex" misses various dependencies, and disk-space-free is not actually in jessie.  I have built it with "stack", but that only produces something usable by me (links to stuff in my home dir).

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

The stack build works very nicely, thanks.
