### Please describe the problem.
Recent builds of git-annex spew out many lines such as:

    git-annex: unable to decommit memory: Invalid argument
    git-annex: unable to decommit memory: Invalid argument
    git-annex: unable to decommit memory: Invalid argument
    git-annex: unable to decommit memory: Invalid argument
    git-annex: unable to decommit memory: Invalid argument

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
This happens to me syncing any large repository now.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
git-annex version: 6.20161118-g0a34f08

uname -r: 4.4.14-11.pvops.qubes.x86_64

/etc/system-release: Fedora release 23 (Twenty Three)

### Please provide any additional information below.

I found this: https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/12495

It looks like this is a problem that occurs only on kernels < 4.5, when ghc is built with a newer glibc, I think.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Git annex rocks!
