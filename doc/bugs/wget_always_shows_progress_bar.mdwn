### Please describe the problem.

git annex addurl or importfeed operations were quiet on git-annex versions older than 5.20141219, if
annex.web-options was set to "--quiet". But now the --show-progress option is always passed to wget.

In some use cases this might be nice, but I'm using GNU Parallel to update multiple podcast feeds
concurrently, and it causes wget to output the ugly "dot" indicator for every feed, which is totally
useless since parallel buffers and groups the output. Adding "--no-show-progress" to web-options
does not help (it does not override --show-progress), nor does redirecting stdout to /dev/null.
Redirecting stderr would hide possible errors.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

parallel git annex importfeed --relaxed --quiet ::: http://feeds.feedburner.com/freakonomicsradio

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

5.20151208-1~bpo8+1 on Debian.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

I love git annex and use it daily.
