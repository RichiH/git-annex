`git annex sync` uses a branch named "synced/foo" to sync
changes to branch named "foo", but that same name is used to sync
changes to a branch named "bar/foo".

Also, the adjusted branch code uses "adjusted/foo(unlocked)" for
both "foo" and "bar/foo". And it fails to push changes back from there to
"bar/foo", instead creating a "foo" branch.
