### Please describe the problem.

When using 'git annex repair --verbose' the '--verbose' option is not passed to 'git fsck', on large annexes it takes ages and you don't have feedback...

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Just run 'git-annex repair --verbose'

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

not important, this is just a suggestion
