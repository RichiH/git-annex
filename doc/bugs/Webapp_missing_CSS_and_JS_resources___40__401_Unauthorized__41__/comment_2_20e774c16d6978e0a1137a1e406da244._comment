I don't reproduce the problem here. From where did you install git-annex?

This seems likely to have something to do with the version of yesod it was
built against.

No session cookie is used; the auth token is not supposed to be needed when
accessing urls under `/static/`. Looking at the code, this was not done
explicitly; it seems to have relied on yesod not checking for authorization
for static site parts. I've committed a change, to explicitly skip auth for
`/static/` but without being able to reproduce the problem, can't test it.
