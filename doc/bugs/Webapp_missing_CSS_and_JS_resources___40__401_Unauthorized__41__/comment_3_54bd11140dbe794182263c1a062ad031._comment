Hi Joey,

I installed git-annex using the homebrew recipe from https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/git-annex.rb, OS X 10.11.6 (15G31)

These are the dependencies reported by homebrew:

Build: ghc ✔, cabal-install ✔, pkg-config ✔
Required: gsasl ✔, libidn ✔, libmagic ✔, gnutls ✔, quvi ✔

I've re-installed using \"brew install git-annex --HEAD\" to pull in your latest commit and I can confirm that everything works as expected and the /static/ resources load correctly.

Thanks,
Chris
