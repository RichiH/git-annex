I'm not able to reproduce the original reported problem; it works even when
using the C locale. However, it may be that this patch would fix it:

<pre>
diff --git a/Command/FromKey.hs b/Command/FromKey.hs
index dca63aa..6a81c1f 100644
--- a/Command/FromKey.hs
+++ b/Command/FromKey.hs

 	go status ((keyname,f):rest) | not (null keyname) && not (null f) = do
</pre>

(The NeuroDebian git-annex-standalone may well have had its locale
installation broken by [[!commit c07981122672f6cc87ca08efb57d8a7b1e2f5725]],
which assumes that the git-annex.linux is writable by the user.
I doubt that is related to the original bug report.)
