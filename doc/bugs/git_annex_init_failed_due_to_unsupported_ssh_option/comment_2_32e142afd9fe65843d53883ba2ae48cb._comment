As noted, include appears to not work on a mac at the moment.  This means git-annex silently ignores the included configs, which may be required to ssh to the remotes of interest.  This is happening to me.

My understanding is that ssh aliases are the recommended way of juggling multiple private keys amongst multiple hosts, so it is a required part of many git workflows.  In this particular case, I have set up git annex on a NAS which does not allow multiple ssh users (QNAP) and the authentication is done only via key identity, not username.  Thus, host aliases are necessary.

If one config can't include another, I would prefer an early failure indicating a problem with the config file, or better, a solution where git-annex doesn't require a config.  In this scenario, git fetch remote_name and git annex copy --to remotename do not resolve to the same alias definitions (the latter is missing because of the ignored config!).

I got my setup to work only by finding and manually editing <repo>/.git/annex/ssh_config, which to my knowledge is undocumented (ie when is it written? do any commands change it?); manual mucking around inside .git to me is not a good practice, and for now I have two different alias's defined (in repo and in ~/.ssh/config)
