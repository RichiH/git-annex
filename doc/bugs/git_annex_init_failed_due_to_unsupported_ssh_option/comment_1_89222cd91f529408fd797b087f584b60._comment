You forgot to show the error message from `git annex init` or whatever it
was that failed. A second of paste will save hours of guesswork.

Looking at `man ssh_config` on OSX, it seems ssh 6.9 does not support
the Include directive.

I guess that the detail you left out is that you ran `git annex init` in a
repository that was cloned from another repository over ssh. That makes it
use ssh to probe the remote, and that probing will fail if ssh is too old
to support Include
