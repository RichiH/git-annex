This is indeed not a bug, my external remote is returning a CHECKPRESENT-UNKNOWN, which as designed does not update the location.  I have verified that returning a CHECKPRESENT-FAILURE does indeed update the location.

As for creating a bug without a title, I simply just clicked \"edit\" then \"save\".  I tried it again with another bug and it worked.
