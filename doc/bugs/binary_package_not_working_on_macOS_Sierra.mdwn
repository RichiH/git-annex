### Please describe the problem.
I downloaded the 10.11_El_Capitan dmg package (	2016-11-01 ) but it did not install on macOS Sierra. When I try to run it from command line I got this error:


/Volumes/git-annex/git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS/$ ./git-annex

dyld: malformed mach-o: load commands size (35008) > 32768

Abort trap: 6


I googled around and it seems to be a known issue with Haskell platform on the newer OS:

### What steps will reproduce the problem?


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?


### Please provide any additional information below.

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log


# End of transcript or log.
"""]]

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
