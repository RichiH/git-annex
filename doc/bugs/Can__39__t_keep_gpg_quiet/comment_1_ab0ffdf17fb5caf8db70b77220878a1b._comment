The gnupg-options and gnupg-decrypt-options only apply when git-annex
is running gpg, not when git-annex is running git push which is running
git-remote-gcrypt which is running gpg.

I don't think there's any way to pass gpg options through that chain of
programs. Even if there is, I don't know that it would make sense to use
the git-annex configuration, which normally is used when git-annex is using
gpg in symmetric encryption mode, for git-remote-gcrypt, which is using gpg
in pubic key encryption mode.

I think you should just set gcrypt.gpg-args to whatever options are
appropriate for its use of gpg.
