##What steps will reproduce the problem?

Follow the [share with a friend walkthrough](http://git-annex.branchable.com/assistant/share_with_a_friend_walkthrough/).  I use my Google Talk account to pair with myself.  With the assistant running, log in to Google Talk on the web interface and set your status 'Invisible'.

##What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I expect to remain invisible, but I get the following warning: "Oops! You are not invisible because you're logged into Google Talk from another client, device or location that doesn't support invisibility."

##What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

4.20130314 on Linux.

##Please provide any additional information below.

Syncing between the repositories works ok.
