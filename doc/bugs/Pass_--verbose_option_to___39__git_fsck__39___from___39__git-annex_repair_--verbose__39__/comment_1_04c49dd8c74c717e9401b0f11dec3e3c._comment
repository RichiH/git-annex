git-annex is parsing the output of git fsck to see what sha1s it outputs,
as those may have problems, --verbose would confuse that since it causes
many more sha1s to be output to stdout.

Passing --progress enables a progress display, but it is
displayed on stderr, which is the same place git fsck displays
some errors which git-annex also parses. Any attempt to untangle the
progress and the error messages could be broken by changes to the git fsck
output, so would not be a good idea.

So while this is a good idea, it doesn't work out.
