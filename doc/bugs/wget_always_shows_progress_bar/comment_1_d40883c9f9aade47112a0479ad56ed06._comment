Since 2014, git-annex has used wget -q --show-progress to get a
progress bar without the several other lines of output it would normally
display. Whether a given git-annex build does this depends on what
version of wget it saw at configure time.

Running git-annex with --quiet will disable the wget progress bar (and
other git-annex output). This seems like the thing to do if you're running
git-annex concurrently. (Of course, git-annex also has its own built-in
concurrency with -J which can display multiple download progress bars in a
nice way.)

Still, might as well make the web-options come after the default options so
they can be overridden. Doing so.
