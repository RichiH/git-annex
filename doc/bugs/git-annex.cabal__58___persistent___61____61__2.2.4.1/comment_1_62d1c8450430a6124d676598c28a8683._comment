You have presented cabal with some dependency situation that causes its
solver to blow up. But AFAICS this is only the case in your own particular
environment; it's not the case in my envionment, or Debian's
environment, etc.

If homebrew needs particular dependency versions, you could specify them
locally in a local cabal.config file. Or you could use stack which
should always find a consistent set of dependencies.

I don't think it makes sense for git-annex to pin down versions like
this just because one build environment is having trouble. So I don't
plan to apply this patch.

---- 

Update: Seems the unstated goal was to make it work with ghc 8 which is
still in a state of generally unhappy dependencies. So applied for that
reason.
