It's sufficient to have "* annex.largefiles=(largerthan=100kb)"
in .gitattributes.

Even "* annex.largefiles=(largerthan=0kb)" will reproduce it.

Ok, I see why.. It's running the largefile matcher on the destination file
before it renames the temp file to it!

Seems to have been broken this way ever since addurl got largefiles
support. Testing didn't catch it because it only affects largefiles
expressions that need to examine the file.

Fixed in git. Audited other checkFileMatcher calls for this problem;
the rest are ok.
