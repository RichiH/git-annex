In my `big/git-annex-test-repos/20160830-annex-adjusted.tar.xz.gpg`,
I have a .git/ directory for a repo where `git annex sync` after `git annex add`
apparently committed the files and then fast-forward merged a branch
over top which did not contain the just-added files.

According to the bug reporter:

`git reflog` showed:

	24a8128 HEAD@{3}: merge 24a81287ef63cd064977165b82de56e050c4a576: Fast-forward
	9cdbd4f HEAD@{4}: commit: git-annex in orcus direct
	9cdbd4f Adds the files, 24a8128 deletes them.

Where 9cdbd4f added the files, but then 24a8128 lost them.

The way 24a8128 appears in the reflog there is not what I usually see when
running `git annex sync` on an adjusted branch. Possible smoking gun?

Initial plan: Try to reset the adjusted branch and master back to before 9cdbd4f,
and re-run to try to reproduce this happening.
