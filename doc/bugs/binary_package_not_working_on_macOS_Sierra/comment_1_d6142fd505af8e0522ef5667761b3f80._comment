`otool -l git-annex` shows hundreds of unnecessary RPATHs, removing
them should fix this.

One way would be to use `install_name_tool -delete_rpath` for each 
of them.

It would be better to upgrade to a fixed ghc,
if it has fixed this RPATH mess. ghc 8.0.2 may fix it.
But the OSX autobuilder is using stack, and no stackage LTS or nightly
includes ghc 8.0.2 yet.

Ok, I've put in the `install_name_tool -delete_rpath` workaround
for the dmg build.

Bug reporter: Please see if
<https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/autobuild/x86_64-apple-yosemite/git-annex.dmg>
has fixed the problem for you.
