### Please describe the problem.
directory 1.3.0.0 causes a conflict for "getFileSize"

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Build git-annex with directory 1.3.0.0 (first need to bump max directory version on concurrent-output (and aws if building with s3))

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
6.20161210 on macOS 10.11 El Capitan


### Please provide any additional information below.

[[!format sh """
[23 of 34] Compiling Common           ( Common.hs, dist/setup/Common.o )

Common.hs:3:16: error:
    Conflicting exports for ‘getFileSize’:
       ‘module X’ exports ‘X.getFileSize’
         imported from ‘Utility.Directory’ at Common.hs:28:1-29
         (and originally defined in ‘System.Directory’)
       ‘module X’ exports ‘X.getFileSize’
         imported from ‘Utility.FileSize’ at Common.hs:34:1-28
         (and originally defined at Utility/FileSize.hs:26:1-11)
"""]]

A fix, though possibly not best, is to make this change in Common.hs:
[[!format sh """
import Utility.Directory as X hiding (getFileSize)
"""]]

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
Yes :)
