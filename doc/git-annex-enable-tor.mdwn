# NAME

git-annex enable-tor - enable tor hidden service

# SYNOPSIS

sudo git annex enable-tor $(id -u)

# DESCRIPTION

This command enables a tor hidden service for git-annex.

It has to be run by root, since it modifies `/etc/tor/torrc`.
Pass it your user id number, as output by `id -u`

After this command is run, `git annex remotedaemon` can be run to serve the
tor hidden service, and then `git-annex p2p --gen-address` can be run to
give other users access to your repository via the tor hidden service.
