good idea on parametrizing frequency of updates from json -- indeed we wouldn't want to deal with output from it probably more often than once in a second per file.  Either \"skinny\" progress indication using IDs or full ones (so we could match by e.g. key) would work for us I think

btw, just so that we don't forget.  I guess all of this would also be needed to be done for addurl, copy, move commands, right? (copy and move do not have --json yet) ;)
