THANK YOU for implementing this feature -- we will make use of it soon.
But so we don't do reverse estimation from \"byte-progress\" and \"percent-progress\", and didn't have to get it from a key (which might not have it e.g. in case of URL relaxed backend) -- could you just include in each record the \"byte-target\" (if known) or something like that? ;)  thanks in advance!
