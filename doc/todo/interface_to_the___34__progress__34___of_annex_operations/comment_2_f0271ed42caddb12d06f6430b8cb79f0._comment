sounds good to me... the only remark that to not break compatibility with other git-annex consumers may be there could be additional switch to instruct annex to produce those progress records (e.g. --json-progress) which would only then provide progress reporting back, thus by default staying compatible with current behavior.

as for -J - I guess indeed we could start multiple parallel annex processes operating on the same repository, but I wonder if then necessary locking etc between multiple processes wouldn't introduce additional performance hit etc.
