git-annex uses standard desktop autostart files to make the assistant
be run at login. They are included in the git-annex package. 
Since that works perfectly fine on all linux desktop environments,
I have not bothered with systemd user services for it, 
which after all will only work on systemd systems.

If you want to write some and add a page to
<https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/> about it, that would be fine.
