Syncthing's documentation explains in a nutshell the purpose of system and user services [here](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/autostart.html#using-systemd), and has also some examples of easily adaptable systemd config files for each [here](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/tree/master/etc/linux-systemd).

This provides a common way of managing background services (starting order, auto-restart, â€¦) that I personally prefer over Windows-ish tray-apps.
