I can export metadata to JSON format, which is nice as this can now be read
into any other tool and manipulated. But I cannot find a way to set the
metadata from JSON and so I am left to figure out what changes need to be
made via the g-a interface to get to the desired state, and that is hard to
get right.

Maybe g-a metadata could grow an import-json function which would set
(overwrite) the metadata for the given file(s) from JSON input.

Thanks,
