   * lock, smudge: Fix edge cases where data loss could occur in v6 mode
     when the keys database was not populated.
   * upgrade: Handle upgrade to v6 when the repository already contains
     v6 unlocked files whose content is already present.
   * Improve style of offline html build of website.
   * importfeed: Drop URL parameters from file extension.
     Thanks, James MacMahon.
   * Assistant, repair: Improved filtering out of git fsck lines about
     duplicate file entries in tree objects.
   * test: Deal with gpg-agent behavior change that broke the test suite.
   * Improve ssh socket cleanup code to skip over the cruft that
     NFS sometimes puts in a directory when a file is being deleted.
   * If a transfer fails for some reason, but some data managed to be sent,
     the transfer will be retried. (The assistant already did this.)
   * Run ssh with ServerAliveInterval 60, so that stalled transfers will
     be noticed within about 3 minutes.
     (Any setting in your ~/.ssh/config or /etc/ssh/ssh\_config
     overrides this.)"""]]
