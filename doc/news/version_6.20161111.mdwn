git-annex 6.20161111 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Restarting a crashing git process could result in filename encoding
     issues when not in a unicode locale, as the restarted processes's
     handles were not read in raw mode.
   * Make .git/annex/ssh.config file work with versions of ssh older than
     7.3, which don't support Include. When used with an older version
     of ssh, any ServerAliveInterval in ~/.ssh/config will be overridden
     by .git/annex/ssh.config.
   * S3: Support the special case endpoint needed for the cn-north-1 region.
   * Webapp: Don't list the Frankfurt S3 region, as this (and some other new
     regions) need V4 authorization which the aws library does not yet use.
   * reinject --known: Avoid second, unncessary checksum of file.
   * OSX: Remove RPATHs from git-annex binary, which are not needed,
     slow down startup, and break the OSX Sierra linker.
   * webapp: Explicitly avoid checking for auth in static subsite
     requests. Yesod didn't used to do auth checks for that, but this may
     have changed.
   * Linux standalone: Avoid using hard links in the tarball so it can be
     untarred on eg, afs which does not support them."""]]
