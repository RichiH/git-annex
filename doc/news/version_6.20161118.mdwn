git-annex 6.20161118 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * git-annex.cabal: Loosen bounds on persistent to allow 2.5, which
     on Debian has been patched to work with esqueleto.
     This may break cabal's resolver on non-Debian systems;
     if so, either use stack to build, or run cabal with
     --constraint='persistent ==2.2.4.1'
     Hopefully this mess with esqueleto will be resolved soon.
   * sync: Pass --allow-unrelated-histories to git merge when used with git
     git 2.9.0 or newer. This makes merging a remote into a freshly created
     direct mode repository work the same as it works in indirect mode.
   * Avoid backtraces on expected failures when built with ghc 8;
     only use backtraces for unexpected errors.
   * fsck --all --from was checking the existence and content of files
     in the local repository, rather than on the special remote. Oops.
   * Linux arm standalone: Build with a 32kb page size, which is needed
     on several ARM NAS devices, including Drobo 5N, and WD NAS."""]]
