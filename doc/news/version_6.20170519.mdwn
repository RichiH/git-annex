   * Ssh password prompting improved when using -J for concurrency.
     When ssh connection caching is enabled (and when GIT\_ANNEX\_USE\_GIT\_SSH
     is not set), only one ssh password prompt will be made per host, and
     only one ssh password prompt will be made at a time.
   * When built with concurrent-output 1.9, ssh password prompts will no
     longer interfere with the -J display.
   * Removed dependency on MissingH, instead depending on the split library.
   * Progress is displayed for transfers of files of unknown size.
   * Work around bug in git 2.13.0 involving GIT\_COMMON\_DIR that broke
     merging changes into adjusted branches."""]]
