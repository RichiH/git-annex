git-annex (4.20130816) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Debian: Run the builtin test suite as an autopkgtest.
  * Debian: Recommend ssh-askpass, which ssh will use when the assistant
    is run w/o a tty. Closes: #719832
  * sync, merge: Bug fix: Don't try to merge into master when in a bare repo.
  * import: Add options to control handling of duplicate files:
    --duplicate, --deduplicate, and --clean-duplicates
  * mirror: New command, makes two repositories contain the same set of files.
  * Set --config=/dev/null when running wget to ensure resuming works properly.

git-annex (4.20130815) unstable; urgency=low

  * assistant, watcher: .gitignore files and other git ignores are now
    honored, when git 1.8.4 or newer is installed.
    (Thanks, Adam Spiers, for getting the necessary support into git for this.)
  * importfeed: Ignores transient problems with feeds. Only exits nonzero
    when a feed has repeatedly had a problems for at least 1 day.
  * importfeed: Fix handling of dots in extensions.
  * Windows: Added support for encrypted special remotes.
  * Windows: Fixed permissions problem that prevented removing files
    from directory special remote. Directory special remotes now fully usable.

git-annex (4.20130802) unstable; urgency=low

  * dropunused behavior change: Now refuses to drop the last copy of a
    file, unless you use the --force.
    This was the last place in git-annex that could remove data referred
    to by the git history, without being forced.
    Like drop, dropunused checks remotes, and honors the global
    annex.numcopies setting. (However, .gitattributes settings cannot
    apply to unused files.) 
  * Fix inverted logic in last release's fix for data loss bug,
    that caused git-annex sync on FAT or other crippled filesystems to add
    symlink standin files to the annex.
  * importfeed can be used to import files from podcast feeds.
  * webapp: When setting up a dedicated ssh key to access the annex
    on a host, set IdentitiesOnly to prevent the ssh-agent from forcing
    use of a different ssh key. That could result in unncessary password
    prompts, or prevent git-annex-shell from being run on the remote host.
  * webapp: Improve handling of remotes whose setup has stalled.
  * Add status message to XMPP presence tag, to identify to others that
    the client is a git-annex client. Closes: #717652
  * webapp: When creating a repository on a removable drive, set
    core.fsyncobjectfiles, to help prevent data loss when the drive is yanked.
  * Always build with -threaded, to avoid a deadlock when communicating with
    gpg.
  * unused: No longer shows as unused tmp files that are actively being
    transferred.
  * assistant: Fix NetWatcher to not sync with remotes that have
    remote.<name>.annex-sync set to false.
  * assistant: Fix deadlock that could occur when adding a lot of files
    at once in indirect mode.
  * assistant: Fix bug that caused it to stall when adding a very large
    number of files at once (around 5 thousand).
  * OSX: Make git-annex-webapp run in the background, so that the app icon
    can be clicked on the open a new webapp when the assistant is already
    running.
  * Improve test suite on Windows; now tests git annex sync.
  * Fix a few bugs involving filenames that are at or near the filesystem's
    maximum filename length limit.
  * find: Avoid polluting stdout with progress messages. Closes: #718186
  * Escape ':' in file/directory names to avoid it being treated
    as a pathspec by some git commands. Closes: #718185
  * Slow and ugly work around for bug #718517 in git 1.8.4~rc0, which broke
    git-cat-file --batch for filenames containing spaces.
    (Will be reverted after next git pre-release fixes the problem.)

git-annex (4.20130723) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix data loss bug when adding an (uncompressed) tarball of a
    git-annex repository, or other file that begins with something
    that can be mistaken for a git-annex link. Closes: #717456
  * New improved version of the git-annex logo, contributed by
    John Lawrence.
  * Rsync.net have committed to support git-annex and offer a special
    discounted rate for git-annex users. Updated the webapp to reflect this.
    http://www.rsync.net/products/git-annex-pricing.html
  * Install XDG desktop icon files.
  * Support unannex and uninit in direct mode.
  * Support import in direct mode.
  * webapp: Better display of added files.
  * fix: Preserve the original mtime of fixed symlinks.
  * uninit: Preserve .git/annex/objects at the end, if it still
    has content, so that old versions of files and deleted files
    are not deleted. Print a message with some suggested actions.
  * When a transfer is already being run by another process,
    proceed on to the next file, rather than dying.
  * Fix checking when content is present in a non-bare repository
    accessed via http.
  * Display byte sizes with more precision.
  * watcher: Fixed a crash that could occur when a directory was renamed
    or deleted before it could be scanned.
  * watcher: Partially worked around a bug in hinotify, no longer crashes
    if hinotify cannot process a directory (but can't detect changes in it)
  * directory special remote: Fix checking that there is enough disk space
    to hold an object, was broken when using encryption.
  * webapp: Differentiate between creating a new S3/Glacier/WebDav remote,
    and initializing an existing remote. When creating a new remote, avoid
    conflicts with other existing (or deleted) remotes with the same name.
  * When an XMPP server has SRV records, try them, but don't then fall
    back to the regular host if they all fail.
  * For long hostnames, use a hash of the hostname to generate the socket
    file for ssh connection caching.

git-annex (4.20130709) unstable; urgency=low

  * --all: New switch that makes git-annex operate on all data stored
    in the git annex, including old versions of files. Supported by
    fsck, get, move, copy.
  * --unused: New switch that makes git-annex operate on all data found
    by the last run of git annex unused. Supported by fsck, move, copy.
  * get, move, copy: Can now be run in a bare repository,
    like fsck already could. --all is enabled automatically in this case.
  * merge: Now also merges synced/master or similar branches, which 
    makes it useful to put in a post-receive hook to make a repository
    automatically update its working copy when git annex sync or the assistant
    sync with it.
  * webapp: Fix ssh setup with nonstandard port, broken in last release.
  * init: Detect systems on which git commit fails due to not being able to
    determine the FQDN, and put in a workaround so committing to the git-annex
    branch works.
  * addurl --pathdepth: Fix failure when the pathdepth specified is deeper
    than the urls's path.
  * Windows: Look for .exe extension when searching for a command in path.
  * Pass -f to curl when downloading a file with it, so it propigates failure. 
  * Windows: Fix url to object when using a http remote.
  * webapp: Fix authorized_keys line added when setting up a rsync remote
    on a server that also supports git-annex, to not force running
    git-annex-shell.
  * OSX Mountain Lion: Fixed gpg bundled in dmg to not fail due to a missing
    gpg-agent.
  * Android: gpg is built without --enable-minimal, so it interoperates
    better with other gpg builds that may default to using other algorithms
    for encryption.
  * dropunused, addunused: Complain when asked to operate on a number that
    does not correspond to any unused key.
  * fsck: Don't claim to fix direct mode when run on a symlink whose content
    is not present.
  * Make --numcopies override annex.numcopies set in .gitattributes.

git-annex (4.20130627) unstable; urgency=low

  * assistant --autostart: Automatically ionices the daemons it starts.
  * assistant: Daily sanity check thread is run niced.
  * bup: Handle /~/ in bup remote paths.
    Thanks, Oliver Matthews
  * fsck: Ensures that direct mode is used for files when it's enabled.
  * webapp: Fix bug when setting up a remote ssh repo repeatedly on the same
    server.
  * webapp: Ensure that ssh keys generated for different directories
    on a server are always different.
  * webapp: Fix bug setting up ssh repo if the user enters "~/" at the start 
    of the path.
  * assistant: Fix bug that prevented adding files written by gnucash, 
    and more generally support adding hard links to files. However,
    other operations on hard links are still unsupported.
  * webapp: Fix bug that caused the webapp to hang when built with yesod 1.2.

git-annex (4.20130621) unstable; urgency=low

  * Supports indirect mode on encfs in paranoia mode, and other
    filesystems that do not support hard links, but do support
    symlinks and other POSIX filesystem features.
  * Android: Add .thumbnails to .gitignore when setting up a camera
    repository.
  * Android: Make the "Open webapp" menu item open the just created
    repository when a new repo is made.
  * webapp: When the user switches to display a different repository,
    that repository becomes the default repository to be displayed next time
    the webapp gets started.
  * glacier: Better handling of the glacier inventory, which avoids
    duplicate uploads to the same glacier repository by `git annex copy`.
  * Direct mode: No longer temporarily remove write permission bit of files
    when adding them.
  * sync: Better support for bare git remotes. Now pushes directly to the
    master branch on such a remote, instead of to synced/master. This
    makes it easier to clone from a bare git remote that has been populated
    with git annex sync or by the assistant.
  * Android: Fix use of cp command to not try to use features present
    only on build system.
  * Windows: Fix hang when adding several files at once.
  * assistant: In direct mode, objects are now only dropped when all
    associated files are unwanted. This avoids a repreated drop/get loop
    of a file that has a copy in an archive directory, and a copy not in an
    archive directory. (Indirect mode still has some buggy behavior in this
    area, since it does not keep track of associated files.)
    Closes: #712060
  * status: No longer shows dead repositories.
  * annex.debug can now be set to enable debug logging by default.
    The webapp's debugging check box does this.
  * fsck: Avoid getting confused by Windows path separators
  * Windows: Multiple bug fixes, including fixing the data written to the
    git-annex branch.
  * Windows: The test suite now passes on Windows (a few broken parts are
    disabled).
  * assistant: On Linux, the expensive transfer scan is run niced.
  * Enable assistant and WebDAV support on powerpc and sparc architectures,
    which now have the necessary dependencies built.

git-annex (4.20130601) unstable; urgency=medium

  * XMPP: Git push over xmpp made much more robust.
  * XMPP: Avoid redundant and unncessary pushes. Note that this breaks
    compatibility with previous versions of git-annex, which will refuse
    to accept any XMPP pushes from this version.
  * XMPP: Send pings and use them to detect when contact with the server
    is lost.
  * hook special remote: Added combined hook program support.
  * Android app: Avoid using hard links to app's lib directory, which
    is sometimes on a different filesystem than the data directory.
  * Fix bug in parsing of parens in some preferred content expressions.
    This fixes the behavior of the manual mode group.
  * assistant: Work around git-cat-file's not reloading the index after files
    are staged.
  * Improve error handling when getting uuid of http remotes to auto-ignore,
    like with ssh remotes.
  * content: New command line way to view and configure a repository's
    preferred content settings.
  * sync: Fix double merge conflict resolution handling.
  * XMPP: Fix a file descriptor leak.
  * Android: Added an "Open WebApp" item to the terminal's menu.
  * Android: Work around Android devices where the `am` command doesn't work.
  * Can now restart certain long-running git processes if they crash, and
    continue working.

  * Sanitize debian changelog version before putting it into cabal file.
    Closes: #708619
  * Switch to MonadCatchIO-transformers for better handling of state while
    catching exceptions.
  * Fix a zombie that could result when running a process like gpg to
    read and write to it.
  * Allow building with gpg2.
  * Disable building with the haskell threaded runtime when the webapp
    is not built. This may fix builds on mips, s390x and sparc, which are
    failing to link -lHSrts_thr
  * Temporarily build without webapp on kfreebsd-i386, until yesod is
    installable there again.
  * Direct mode bug fix: After a conflicted merge was automatically resolved,
    the content of a file that was already present could incorrectly
    be replaced with a symlink.
  * Fix a bug in the git-annex branch handling code that could
    cause info from a remote to not be merged and take effect immediately.
  * Direct mode is now fully tested by the test suite.
  * Detect bad content in ~/.config/git-annex/program and look in PATH instead.
  * OSX: Fixed gpg included in dmg.
  * Linux standalone: Back to being built with glibc 2.13 for maximum
    portability.

git-annex (4.20130516) unstable; urgency=low

  * Android: The webapp is ported and working.
  * Windows: There is a very rough Windows port. Do not trust it with
    important data.
  * git-annex-shell: Ensure that received files can be read. Files
    transferred from some Android devices may have very broken permissions
    as received.
  * direct mode: Direct mode commands now work on files staged in the index,
    they do not need to be committed to git.
  * Temporarily add an upper bound to the version of yesod that can be built
    with, since yesod 1.2 has a great many changes that will require extensive
    work on the webapp.
  * Disable building with the haskell threaded runtime when the assistant
    is not built. This may fix builds on s390x and sparc, which are failing
    to link -lHSrts_thr
  * Avoid depending on regex-tdfa on mips, mipsel, and s390, where it fails
    to build.
  * direct: Fix a bug that could cause some files to be left in indirect mode.
  * When initializing a directory special remote with a relative path,
    the path is made absolute.
  * SHA: Add a runtime sanity check that sha commands output something
    that appears to be a real sha.
  * configure: Better checking that sha commands output in the desired format.
  * rsync special remotes: When sending from a crippled filesystem, use
    the destination's default file permissions, as the local ones can
    be arbitrarily broken. (Ie, ----rwxr-x for files on Android)
  * migrate: Detect if a file gets corrupted while it's being migrated.
  * Debian: Add a menu file.

git-annex (4.20130501) unstable; urgency=low

  * sync, assistant: Behavior changes: Sync with remotes that have
    annex-ignore set, so that git remotes on servers without git-annex
    installed can be used to keep clients' git repos in sync.
  * assistant: Work around misfeature in git 1.8.2 that makes
    `git commit --alow-empty -m ""` run an editor.
  * sync: Bug fix, avoid adding to the annex the 
    dummy symlinks used on crippled filesystems.
  * Add public repository group.
    (And inpreferreddir to preferred content expressions.)
  * webapp: Can now set up Internet Archive repositories.
  * S3: Dropping content from the Internet Archive doesn't work, but
    their API indicates it does. Always refuse to drop from there.
  * Automatically register public urls for files uploaded to the
    Internet Archive.
  * To enable an existing special remote, the new enableremote command
    must be used. The initremote command now is used only to create
    new special remotes.
  * initremote: If two existing remotes have the same name,
    prefer the one with a higher trust level.
  * assistant: Improved XMPP protocol to better support multiple repositories
    using the same XMPP account. Fixes bad behavior when sharing with a friend
    when you or the friend have multiple reposotories on an XMPP account.
    Note that XMPP pairing with your own devices still pairs with all
    repositories using your XMPP account.
  * assistant: Fix bug that could cause incoming pushes to not get
    merged into the local tree. Particularly affected XMPP pushes.
  * webapp: Display some additional information about a repository on
    its edit page.
  * webapp: Install FDO desktop menu file when started in standalone mode.
  * webapp: Don't default to making repository in cwd when started
    from within a directory containing a git-annex file (eg, standalone
    tarball directory).
  * Detect systems that have no user name set in GECOS, and also
    don't have user.name set in git config, and put in a workaround
    so that commits to the git-annex branch (and the assistant)
    will still succeed despite git not liking the system configuration.
  * webapp: When told to add a git repository on a remote server, and
    the repository already exists as a non-bare repository, use it,
    rather than initializing a bare repository in the same directory.
  * direct, indirect: Refuse to do anything when the assistant
    or git-annex watch daemon is running.
  * assistant: When built with git before 1.8.0, use `git remote rm`
    to delete a remote. Newer git uses `git remote remove`.
  * rmurl: New command, removes one of the recorded urls for a file.
  * Detect when the remote is broken like bitbucket is, and exits 0 when
    it fails to run git-annex-shell.
  * assistant: Several improvements to performance and behavior when
    performing bulk adds of a large number of files (tens to hundreds
    of thousands).
  * assistant: Sanitize XMPP presence information logged for debugging.
  * webapp: Now automatically fills in any creds used by an existing remote
    when creating a new remote of the same type. Done for Internet Archive,
    S3, Glacier, and Box.com remotes.
  * Store an annex-uuid file in the bucket when setting up a new S3 remote.
  * Support building with DAV 0.4.

  * initremote: Generates encryption keys with high quality entropy.
    This can be disabled using --fast to get the old behavior.
    The assistant still uses low-quality entropy when creating encrypted
    remotes, to avoid delays. (Thanks, guilhem for the patch.)
  * Bugfix: Direct mode no longer repeatedly checksums duplicated files.
  * assistant: Work around horrible, terrible, very bad behavior of
    gnome-keyring, by not storing special-purpose ssh keys in ~/.ssh/*.pub.
    Apparently gnome-keyring apparently will load and indiscriminately use
    such keys in some cases, even if they are not using any of the standard
    ssh key names. Instead store the keys in ~/.ssh/annex/,
    which gnome-keyring will not check.
  * addurl: Bugfix: Did not properly add file in direct mode.
  * assistant: Bug fix to avoid annexing the files that git uses
    to stand in for symlinks on FAT and other filesystem not supporting
    symlinks.
  * Adjust preferred content expressions so that content in archive
    directories is preferred until it has reached an archive or smallarchive
    repository.
  * webapp: New --listen= option allows running the webapp on one computer
    and connecting to it from another. (Note: Does not yet use HTTPS.)
  * Added annex.web-download-command setting.
  * Added per-remote annex-rsync-transport option. (guilhem again)
  * Ssh connection caching is now also used by rsync special remotes.
    (guilhem yet again)
  * The version number is now derived from git, unless built with
    VERSION_FROM_CHANGELOG.
  * assistant: Stop any transfers the assistant initiated on shutdown.
  * assistant: Added sequence numbers to XMPP git push packets. (Not yet used.)
  * addurl: Register transfer so the webapp can see it.
  * addurl: Automatically retry downloads that fail, as long as some
    additional content was downloaded.
  * webapp: Much improved progress bar display for downloads from encrypted
    remotes.
  * Avoid using runghc, as that needs ghci.
  * webapp: When a repository's group is changed, rescan for transfers.
  * webapp: Added animations.
  * webapp: Include the repository directory in the mangled hostname and
    ssh key name, so that a locked down ssh key for one repository is not
    re-used when setting up additional repositories on the same server.
  * Fall back to internal url downloader when built without curl.
  * fsck: Check content of direct mode files (only when the inode cache
    thinks they are unmodified).

  * Remotes can be configured to use other MAC algorithms than HMACSHA1
    to encrypt filenames.
    Thanks, guilhem for the patch.
  * git-annex-shell: Passes rsync --bwlimit options on rsync.
    Thanks, guilhem for the patch.
  * webapp: Added UI to delete repositories. Closes: #689847
  * Adjust built-in preferred content expressions to make most types
    of repositories want content that is only located on untrusted, dead,

  * drop --auto: Fix bug that prevented dropping files from untrusted
    repositories.
  * assistant: Fix bug that could cause direct mode files to be unstaged
    from git.
  * Update working tree files fully atomically.
  * webapp: Improved transfer queue management.
  * init: Probe whether the filesystem supports fifos, and if not,
    disable ssh connection caching.

    transfer repository needs to be configured.
  * Add incrementalbackup repository group.
  * webapp: Encourage user to install git-annex on a server when adding
    a ssh server, rather than just funneling them through to rsync.
  * xmpp: --debug now enables a sanitized dump of the XMPP protocol
  * xmpp: Try harder to detect presence of clients when there's a git push
    to send.
  * xmpp: Re-enable XA flag, since disabling it did not turn out to help
    with the problems Google Talk has with not always sending presence
    messages to clients.
  * map: Combine duplicate repositories, for a nicer looking map.
  * Fix several bugs caused by a bad Ord instance for Remote.
  * webapp: Switch all forms to POST.

  * Bugfix: drop --from an unavailable remote no longer updates the location
    log, incorrectly, to say the remote does not have the key.
  * Bugfix: If the UUID of a remote is not known, prevent --from, --to,
    and other ways of specifying remotes by name from selecting it,
    since it is not possible to sanely use it.
  * Bugfix: Fix bug in inode cache sentinal check, which broke
    copying to local repos if the repo being copied from had moved
    to a different filesystem or otherwise changed all its inodes

  * Switch from using regex-compat to regex-tdfa, as the C regex library
    is rather buggy.
  * status: Can now be run with a directory path to show only the
    status of that directory, rather than the whole annex.
  * Added remote.<name>.annex-gnupg-options setting.

  * assistant: Logs are rotated to avoid them using too much disk space.
  * assistant: Avoid noise in logs from git commit about typechanged
    files in direct mode repositories.
  * assistant: Set gc.auto=0 when creating repositories to prevent
    automatic commits from causing git-gc runs.
  * assistant: If gc.auto=0, run git-gc once a day, packing loose objects
    very non-aggressively.

    combines all their changes into a single commit.
  * assistant: Fix ~/.ssh/git-annex-shell wrapper to work when the
    ssh key does not force a command.
  * assistant: Be smarter about avoiding unncessary transfers.

  * webapp: Work around bug in Warp's slowloris attack prevention code,
    that caused regular browsers to stall when they reuse a connection
    after leaving it idle for 30 seconds.
    (See https://github.com/yesodweb/wai/issues/146)
  * webapp: New preferences page allows enabling/disabling debug logging

    always using git's pseudosymlink files in such repositories.
  * webapp: Allow creating repositories on filesystems that lack support for
    symlinks.
  * webapp: Can now add a new local repository, and make it sync with
    the main local repository.
  * Android: Bundle now includes openssh.
  * Android: Support ssh connection caching.
  * Android: Assistant is fully working. (But no webapp yet.)
  * Direct mode: Support filesystems like FAT which can change their inodes
    each time they are mounted.
  * Direct mode: Fix support for adding a modified file.
  * Avoid passing -p to rsync, to interoperate with crippled filesystems.
    Closes: #700282
  * Additional GIT_DIR support bugfixes. May actually work now.
  * webapp: Display any error message from git init if it fails to create
    a repository.
  * Fix a reversion in matching globs introduced in the last release,
    where "*" did not match files inside subdirectories. No longer uses
    the Glob library.

    log was out of date.
  * Makefile now builds using cabal, taking advantage of cabal's automatic
    detection of appropriate build flags.

git-annex (3.20130216) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now uses the Haskell uuid library, rather than needing a uuid program.
  * Now uses the Haskell Glob library, rather than pcre-light, avoiding
    the need to install libpcre. Currently done only for Cabal or when
    the Makefile is made to use -DWITH_GLOB
  * Android port now available (command-line only).
  * New annex.crippledfilesystem setting, allows use of git-annex
    repositories on FAT and even worse filesystems; avoiding use of
    hard links and locked down permissions settings. (Support is incomplete.)
  * init: Detect when the repository is on a filesystem that does not
    support hard links, or symlinks, or unix permissions, and set
    annex.crippledfilesystem, as well as annex.direct.
  * add: Improved detection of files that are modified while being added.
  * Fix a bug in direct mode, introduced in the previous release, where
    if a file was dropped and then got back, it would be stored in indirect
    mode.

git-annex (3.20130124) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added source repository group, that only retains files until they've
    been transferred to another repository. Useful for things like
    repositories on cameras.
  * Added manual repository group. Use to prevent the assistant from
    downloading any file contents to keep things in sync. Instead
    `git annex get`, `git annex drop` etc can be used manually as desired.
  * webapp: More adjustments to longpoll code to deal with changes in
    variable quoting in different versions of shakespeare-js.
  * webapp: Avoid an error if a transfer is stopped just as it finishes.
    Closes: #698184 
  * webapp: Now always logs to .git/annex/daemon.log
  * webapp: Has a page to view the log, accessed from the control menu.
  * webapp: Fix crash adding removable drive that has an annex directory
    in it that is not a git repository.
  * Deal with incompatability in gpg2, which caused prompts for encryption
    passphrases rather than using the supplied --passphrase-fd.
  * bugfix: Union merges involving two or more repositories could sometimes
    result in data from one repository getting lost. This could result
    in the location log data becoming wrong, and fsck being needed to fix it.
  * sync: Automatic merge conflict resolution now stages deleted files.
  * Depend on git 1.7.7.6 for --no-edit. Closes: #698399
  * Fix direct mode mapping code to always store direct mode filenames
    relative to the top of the repository, even when operating inside a
    subdirectory.
  * fsck: Detect and fix consistency errors in direct mode mapping files.
  * Avoid filename encoding errors when writing direct mode mappings.

git-annex (3.20130114) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now handles the case where a file that's being transferred to a remote
    is modified in place, which direct mode allows. When this
    happens, the transfer now fails, rather than allow possibly corrupt
    data into the remote.
  * fsck: Better checking of file content in direct mode.
  * drop: Suggest using git annex move when numcopies prevents dropping a file.
  * webapp: Repo switcher filters out repos that do not exist any more
    (or are on a drive that's not mounted).
  * webapp: Use IP address, rather than localhost, since some systems may
    have configuration problems or other issues that prevent web browsers
    from connecting to the right localhost IP for the webapp.
  * webapp: Adjust longpoll code to work with recent versions of
    shakespeare-js.
  * assistant: Support new gvfs dbus names used in Gnome 3.6.
  * In direct mode, files with the same key are no longer hardlinked, as
    that would cause a surprising behavior if modifying one, where the other
    would also change.
  * webapp: Avoid illegal characters in hostname when creating S3 or
    Glacier remote.
  * assistant: Avoid committer crashing if a file is deleted at the wrong
    instant.

  * assistant: Make expensive transfer scan work fully in direct mode.
  * More commands work in direct mode repositories: find, whereis, move, copy,
    drop, log, fsck, add, addurl.
  * sync: No longer automatically adds files in direct mode.
  * assistant: Detect when system is not configured with a user name,
    and set environment to prevent git from failing.
  * direct: Avoid hardlinking symlinks that point to the same content
    when the content is not present.
  * Fix transferring files to special remotes in direct mode.

git-annex (3.20130102) unstable; urgency=low

  * direct, indirect: New commands, that switch a repository to and from
    direct mode. In direct mode, files are accessed directly, rather than
    via symlinks. Note that direct mode is currently experimental. Many
    git-annex commands do not work in direct mode. Some git commands can
    cause data loss when used in direct mode repositories.
  * assistant: Now uses direct mode by default when setting up a new
    local repository.
  * OSX assistant: Uses the FSEvents API to detect file changes.
    This avoids issues with running out of file descriptors on large trees,
    as well as allowing detection of modification of files in direct mode.
    Other BSD systems still use kqueue.
  * kqueue: Fix bug that made broken symlinks not be noticed.
  * vicfg: Quote filename. Closes: #696193
  * Bugfix: Fixed bug parsing transfer info files, where the newline after
    the filename was included in it. This was generally benign, but in
    the assistant, it caused unexpected dropping of preferred content.
  * Bugfix: Remove leading \ from checksums output by sha*sum commands,
    when the filename contains \ or a newline. Closes: #696384
  * fsck: Still accept checksums with a leading \ as valid, now that
    above bug is fixed.
  * SHA*E backends: Exclude non-alphanumeric characters from extensions.
  * migrate: Remove leading \ in SHA* checksums, and non-alphanumerics
    from extensions of SHA*E keys.

  * watch: Avoid leaving hard links to files behind in .git/annex/tmp
    if a file is deleted or moved while it's being quarantined in preparation
    to being added to the annex.
  * Allow `git annex drop --from web`; of course this does not remove
    any file from the web, but it does make git-annex remove all urls
    associated with a file.
  * webapp: S3 and Glacier forms now have a select list of all
    currently-supported AWS regions.
  * webdav: Avoid trying to set props, avoiding incompatability with
    livedrive.com. Needs DAV version 0.3.

    when preferred content settings want it.
  * drop --auto: Fix dropping content when there are no preferred content
    settings.
  * webapp: Allow user to specify the port when setting up a ssh or rsync
    remote.
  * assistant: Fix syncing to just created ssh remotes.
  * Enable WebDAV support in Debian package. Closes: #695532

  * Bugfix: directory special remote could loop forever storing a key 
    when a too small chunksize was configured.
  * Allow controlling whether login credentials for S3 and webdav are
    committed to the repository, by setting embedcreds=yes|no when running
    initremote.
  * Added smallarchive repository group, that only archives files that are
    in archive directories. Used by default for glacier when set up in the
    webapp.
  * assistant: Fixed handling of toplevel archive directory and
    client repository group.
  * assistant: Apply preferred content settings when a new symlink
    is created, or a symlink gets renamed. Made archive directories work.

  * bup: Don't pass - to bup-split to make it read stdin; bup 0.25
    does not accept that.
  * bugfix: Don't fail transferring content from read-only repos.
    Closes: #691341
  * configure: Check that checksum programs produce correct checksums.
  * Re-enable dbus, using a new version of the library that fixes the memory
    leak.
  * NetWatcher: When dbus connection is lost, try to reconnect.
  * Use USER and HOME environment when set, and only fall back to getpwent,
    which doesn't work with LDAP or NIS.
  * rsync special remote: Include annex-rsync-options when running rsync

    scan is running and queueing new transfers for that remote.
  * The standalone binaries are now built to not use ssh connection caching,
    in order to work with old versions of ssh.
  * A relative core.worktree is relative to the gitdir. Now that this is
    handled correctly, git-annex can be used in git submodules.
  * Temporarily disable use of dbus, as the haskell dbus library blows up
    when losing connection, which will need to be fixed upstream.

  * webapp: An interface for managing and configuring the assistant.
  * The default backend used when adding files to the annex is changed
    from SHA256 to SHA256E, to simplify interoperability with OSX, media
    players, and various programs that needlessly look at symlink targets.
    To get old behavior, add a .gitattributes containing: * annex.backend=SHA256
  * init: If no description is provided for a new repository, one will
    automatically be generated, like "joey@gnu:~/foo"
  * test: Set a lot of git environment variables so testing works in strange
    environments that normally need git config to set names, etc.
    Closes: #682351 Thanks, gregor herrmann
  * Disable ssh connection caching if the path to the control socket would be
    too long (and use relative path to minimise path to the control socket).
  * migrate: Check content before generating the new key, to avoid generating
    a key for corrupt data.
  * Support repositories created with --separate-git-dir. Closes: #684405
  * reinject: When the provided file doesn't match, leave it where it is,
    rather than moving to .git/annex/bad/
  * Avoid crashing on encoding errors in filenames when writing transfer info
    files and reading from checksum commands.
  * sync: Pushes the git-annex branch to remote/synced/git-annex, rather

  * Rsync special remotes can be configured with shellescape=no
    to avoid shell quoting that is normally done when using rsync over ssh.
    This is known to be needed for certian rsync hosting providers
    (specificially hidrive.strato.com) that use rsync over ssh but do not
    pass it through the shell.
  * dropunused: Allow specifying ranges to drop.
  * addunused: New command, the opposite of dropunused, it relinks unused
    content into the git repository.
  * Fix use of several config settings: annex.ssh-options,
    annex.rsync-options, annex.bup-split-options. (And adjust types to avoid
    the bugs that broke several config settings.)

    (Requested by the Internet Archive)
  * uninit: Clear annex.uuid from .git/config. Closes: #670639
  * Added shared cipher mode to encryptable special remotes. This option

  * git-annex (but not git-annex-shell) supports the git help.autocorrect
    configuration setting, doing fuzzy matching using the restricted
    Damerau-Levenshtein edit distance, just as git does. This adds a build

  * fsck: Fix up any broken links and misplaced content caused by the
    directory hash calculation bug fixed in the last release.
  * sync: Sync to lower cost remotes first.
  * status: Fixed to run in constant space.
  * status: More accurate display of sizes of tmp and bad keys.
  * unused: Now uses a bloom filter, and runs in constant space.
    Use of a bloom filter does mean it will not notice a small
    number of unused keys. For repos with up to half a million keys,
    it will miss one key in 1000.
  * Added annex.bloomcapacity and annex.bloomaccuracy, which can be
    adjusted as desired to tune the bloom filter.
  * status: Display amount of memory used by bloom filter, and
    detect when it's too small for the number of keys in a repository.
  * git-annex-shell: Runs hooks/annex-content after content is received
    or dropped.
  * Work around a bug in rsync (IMHO) introduced by openSUSE's SIP patch.
  * git-annex now behaves as git-annex-shell if symlinked to and run by that
    name. The Makefile sets this up, saving some 8 mb of installed size.
  * git-union-merge is a demo program, so it is no longer built by default.

  * Add configurable hooks that are run when git-annex starts and stops
    using a remote: remote.name.annex-start-command and
    remote.name.annex-stop-command
  * Fix a bug in symlink calculation code, that triggered in rare

  * Modifications to support ghc 7.4's handling of filenames.
    This version can only be built with ghc 7.4 or newer. See the ghc7.0
    branch for older ghcs.
  * S3: Fix irrefutable pattern failure when accessing encrypted S3
    credentials.
  * Use the haskell IfElse library.
  * Fix teardown of stale cached ssh connections.
  * Fixed to use the strict state monad, to avoid leaking all kinds of memory
    due to lazy state update thunks when adding/fixing many files.
  * Fixed some memory leaks that occurred when committing journal files.
  * Added a annex.queuesize setting, useful when adding hundreds of thousands
    of files on a system with plenty of memory.
  * whereis: Prints the urls of files that the web special remote knows about.
  * addurl --fast: Verifies that the url can be downloaded (only getting
    its head), and records the size in the key.
  * When checking that an url has a key, verify that the Content-Length,
    if available, matches the size of the key.
  * addurl: Added a --file option, which can be used to specify what
    file the url is added to. This can be used to override the default
    filename that is used when adding an url, which is based on the url.
    Or, when the file already exists, the url is recorded as another
    location of the file.
  * addurl: Normalize badly encoded urls.
  * addurl: Add --pathdepth option.
  * rekey: New plumbing level command, can be used to change the keys used
    for files en masse.
  * Store web special remote url info in a more efficient location.
    (Urls stored with this version will not be visible to older versions.)
  * Deal with NFS problem that caused a failure to remove a directory
    when removing content from the annex.
  * Make a single location log commit after a remote has received or
    dropped files. Uses a new "git-annex-shell commit" command when available.
  * To avoid commits of data to the git-annex branch after each command
    is run, set annex.alwayscommit=false. Its data will then be committed
    less frequently, when a merge or sync is done.
  * configure: Check if ssh connection caching is supported by the installed
    version of ssh and default annex.sshcaching accordingly.
  * move --from, copy --from: Now 10 times faster when scanning to find
    files in a remote on a local disk; rather than go through the location log
    to see which files are present on the remote, it simply looks at the 
    disk contents directly.

  * fsck --from: Fscking a remote is now supported. It's done by retrieving
    the contents of the specified files from the remote, and checking them,
    so can be an expensive operation. Still, if the remote is a special
    remote, or a git repository that you cannot run fsck in locally, it's
    nice to have the ability to fsck it.
  * If you have any directory special remotes, now would be a good time to
    fsck them, in case you were hit by the data loss bug fixed in the
    previous release!
  * fsck --from remote --fast: Avoids expensive file transfers, at the
    expense of not checking file size and/or contents.
  * Ssh connection caching is now enabled automatically by git-annex.
    Only one ssh connection is made to each host per git-annex run, which
    can speed some things up a lot, as well as avoiding repeated password
    prompts. Concurrent git-annex processes also share ssh connections.
    Cached ssh connections are shut down when git-annex exits.
  * To disable the ssh caching (if for example you have your own broader
    ssh caching configuration), set annex.sshcaching=false.

    suitable for use here are the same).
  * Dotfiles, and files inside dotdirs are not added by "git annex add"
    unless the dotfile or directory is explicitly listed. So "git annex add ."
    will add all untracked files in the current directory except for those in
    dotdirs.
  * Added quickcheck to build dependencies, and fail if test suite cannot be
    built.
  * fsck: Do backend-specific check before checking numcopies is satisfied.

git-annex (3.20111231) unstable; urgency=low

  * sync: Improved to work well without a central bare repository.
    Thanks to Joachim Breitner.
  * Rather than manually committing, pushing, pulling, merging, and git annex
    merging, we encourage you to give "git annex sync" a try.
  * sync --fast: Selects some of the remotes with the lowest annex.cost
    and syncs those, in addition to any specified at the command line.
  * Union merge now finds the least expensive way to represent the merge.
  * reinject: Add a sanity check for using an annexed file as the source file.
  * Properly handle multiline git config values.
  * Fix the hook special remote, which bitrotted a while ago.
  * map: --fast disables use of dot to display map
  * Test suite improvements. Current top-level test coverage: 75%
  * Improve deletion of files from rsync special remotes. Closes: #652849
  * Add --include, which is the same as --not --exclude.
  * Format strings can be specified using the new --format option, to control
    what is output by git annex find.
  * Support git annex find --json
  * Fixed behavior when multiple insteadOf configs are provided for the
    same url base.
  * Can now be built with older git versions (before 1.7.7); the resulting
    binary should only be used with old git.
  * Updated to build with monad-control 0.3.

  * Ensure that git-annex branch changes are merged into git-annex's index,

    git-annex branch to get reverted. As a side effect, it's now safe
    for users to check out and commit changes directly to the git-annex
    branch.
  * map: Fix a failure to detect a loop when both repositories are local
    and refer to each other with relative paths.
  * Prevent key names from containing newlines.
  * add: If interrupted, add can leave files converted to symlinks but not
    yet added to git. Running the add again will now clean up this situtation.
  * Fix caching of decrypted ciphers, which failed when drop had to check
    multiple different encrypted special remotes.
  * unannex: Can be run on files that have been added to the annex, but not
    yet committed.
  * sync: New command that synchronises the local repository and default
    remote, by running git commit, pull, and push for you.
  * Version monad-control dependency in cabal file.

  * The VFAT filesystem on recent versions of Linux, when mounted with
    shortname=mixed, does not get along well with git-annex's mixed case
    .git/annex/objects hash directories. To avoid this problem, new content
    is now stored in all-lowercase hash directories. Except for non-bare
    repositories which would be a pain to transition and cannot be put on FAT.
    (Old mixed-case hash directories are still tried for backwards
    compatibility.)
  * Flush json output, avoiding a buffering problem that could result in
    doubled output.
  * Avoid needing haskell98 and other fixes for new ghc. Thanks, Mark Wright.
  * Bugfix: dropunused did not drop keys with two spaces in their name.
  * Support for storing .git/annex on a different device than the rest of the
    git repository.
  * --inbackend can be used to make git-annex only operate on files

  * init: When run in an already initalized repository, and without
    a description specified, don't delete the old description. 
  * Optimised union merging; now only runs git cat-file once, and runs

  * The default backend used when adding files to the annex is changed
    from WORM to SHA256.
    To get old behavior, add a .gitattributes containing: * annex.backend=WORM
  * Sped up some operations on remotes that are on the same host.
  * copy --to: Fixed leak when copying many files to a remote on the same
    host.
  * uninit: Add guard against being run with the git-annex branch checked out.
  * Fail if --from or --to is passed to commands that do not support them.
  * drop --from is now supported to remove file content from a remote.
  * status: Now always shows the current repository, even when it does not
    appear in uuid.log.
  * fsck: Now works in bare repositories. Checks location log information,
    and file contents. Does not check that numcopies is satisfied, as
    .gitattributes information about numcopies is not available in a bare
    repository.
  * unused, dropunused: Now work in bare repositories.
  * Removed the setkey command, and added a reinject command with a more
    useful interface.
  * The fromkey command now takes the key as its first parameter. The --key
    option is no longer used.
  * Built without any filename containing .git being excluded. Closes: #647215
  * Record uuid when auto-initializing a remote so it shows in status.

  * This version of git-annex only works with git 1.7.7 and newer.
    The breakage with old versions is subtle, and affects the
    annex.numcopies settings in .gitattributes, so be sure to upgrade git
    to 1.7.7. (Debian package now depends on that version.)
  * Don't pass absolute paths to git show-attr, as it started following
    symlinks when that's done in 1.7.7. Instead, use relative paths,
    which show-attr only handles 100% correctly in 1.7.7. Closes: #645046
  * Fix referring to remotes by uuid.
  * New or changed repository descriptions in uuid.log now have a timestamp,
    which is used to ensure the newest description is used when the uuid.log
    has been merged.
  * Note that older versions of git-annex will display the timestamp as part
    of the repository description, which is ugly but otherwise harmless.
  * Add timestamps to trust.log and remote.log too.
  * git-annex-shell: Added the --uuid option.
  * git-annex now asks git-annex-shell to verify that it's operating in 
    the expected repository.
  * Note that this git-annex will not interoperate with remotes using 
    older versions of git-annex-shell.
  * Now supports git's insteadOf configuration, to modify the url
    used to access a remote. Note that pushInsteadOf is not used;
    that and pushurl are reserved for actual git pushes. Closes: #644278
  * status: List all known repositories.
  * When displaying a list of repositories, show git remote names

  * Arbitrarily complex expressions can be built to limit the files git-annex
    operates on, by combining the options --not --and --or -( and -)
    Example: git annex get --exclude '*.mp3' --and --not -( --in usbdrive --or --in archive -)
  * --copies=N can be used to make git-annex only operate on files with
    the specified number of copies. (And --not --copies=N for the inverse.)
  * find: Rather than only showing files whose contents are present,
    when used with --exclude --copies or --in, displays all files that
    match the specified conditions.
  * Note that this is a behavior change for git-annex find! Old behavior
    can be gotten by using: git-annex find --in .
  * status: Massively sped up; remove --fast mode.
  * unused: File contents used by branches and tags are no longer
    considered unused, even when not used by the current branch. This is
    the final piece of the puzzle needed for git-annex to to play nicely

git-annex (3.20110915) unstable; urgency=low

  * whereis: Show untrusted locations separately and do not include in
    location count.
  * Fix build without S3.
  * addurl: Always use whole url as destination filename, rather than
    only its file component.
  * get, drop, copy: Added --auto option, which decides whether
    to get/drop content as needed to work toward the configured numcopies.
  * bugfix: drop and fsck did not honor --exclude

git-annex (3.20110902) unstable; urgency=low

  * Set EMAIL when running test suite so that git does not need to be
    configured first. Closes: #638998
  * The wget command will now be used in preference to curl, if available.
  * init: Make description an optional parameter.
  * unused, status: Sped up by avoiding unnecessary stats of annexed files.
  * unused --remote: Reduced memory use to 1/4th what was used before.
  * Add --json switch, to produce machine-consumable output.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 02 Sep 2011 21:20:37 -0400

git-annex (3.20110819) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now "git annex init" only has to be run once, when a git repository
    is first being created. Clones will automatically notice that git-annex
    is in use and automatically perform a basic initalization. It's
    still recommended to run "git annex init" in any clones, to describe them.
  * Added annex-cost-command configuration, which can be used to vary the
    cost of a remote based on the output of a shell command.
  * Fix broken upgrade from V1 repository. Closes: #638584

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 19 Aug 2011 20:34:09 -0400

git-annex (3.20110817) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix shell escaping in rsync special remote.
  * addurl: --fast can be used to avoid immediately downloading the url.
  * Added support for getting content from git remotes using http (and https).
  * Added curl to Debian package dependencies.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 17 Aug 2011 01:29:02 -0400

git-annex (3.20110719) unstable; urgency=low

  * add: Be even more robust to avoid ever leaving the file seemingly deleted.
    Closes: #634233
  * Bugfix: Make add ../ work.
  * Support the standard git -c name=value
  * unannex: Clean up use of git commit -a.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Jul 2011 23:39:53 -0400

git-annex (3.20110707) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix sign bug in disk free space checking.
  * Bugfix: Forgot to de-escape keys when upgrading. Could result in
    bad location log data for keys that contain [&:%] in their names.
    (A workaround for this problem is to run git annex fsck.)
  * add: Avoid a failure mode that resulted in the file seemingly being
    deleted (content put in the annex but no symlink present).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 07 Jul 2011 19:29:39 -0400

git-annex (3.20110705) unstable; urgency=low

  * uninit: Delete the git-annex branch and .git/annex/
  * unannex: In --fast mode, file content is left in the annex, and a
    hard link made to it.
  * uninit: Use unannex in --fast mode, to support unannexing multiple
    files that link to the same content.
  * Drop the dependency on the haskell curl bindings, use regular haskell HTTP.
  * Fix a pipeline stall when upgrading (caused by #624389).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 05 Jul 2011 14:37:39 -0400

git-annex (3.20110702) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now the web can be used as a special remote. 
    This feature replaces the old URL backend.
  * addurl: New command to download an url and store it in the annex.
  * Sped back up fsck, copy --from, and other commands that often
    have to read a lot of information from the git-annex branch. Such
    commands are now faster than they were before introduction of the
    git-annex branch.
  * Always ensure git-annex branch exists.
  * Modify location log parser to allow future expansion.
  * --force will cause add, etc, to operate on ignored files.
  * Avoid mangling encoding when storing the description of repository
    and other content.
  * cabal can now be used to build git-annex. This is substantially
    slower than using make, does not build or install documentation,
    does not run the test suite, and is not particularly recommended,
    but could be useful to some.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 02 Jul 2011 15:00:18 -0400

git-annex (3.20110624) experimental; urgency=low

  * New repository format, annex.version=3. Use `git annex upgrade` to migrate.
  * git-annex now stores its logs in a git-annex branch.
  * merge: New subcommand. Auto-merges the new git-annex branch.
  * Improved handling of bare git repos with annexes. Many more commands will
    work in them.
  * git-annex is now more robust; it will never leave state files
    uncommitted when some other git process comes along and locks the index
    at an inconvenient time.
  * rsync is now used when copying files from repos on other filesystems.
    cp is still used when copying file from repos on the same filesystem,
    since --reflink=auto can make it significantly faster on filesystems
    such as btrfs.
  * Allow --trust etc to specify a repository by name, for temporarily 
    trusting repositories that are not configured remotes.
  * unlock: Made atomic.
  * git-union-merge: New git subcommand, that does a generic union merge
    operation, and operates efficiently without touching the working tree.

git-annex (0.20110601) unstable; urgency=low

  * Minor bugfixes and error message improvements.
  * Massively sped up `git annex lock` by avoiding use of the uber-slow
    `git reset`, and only running `git checkout` once, even when many files
    are being locked.
  * Fix locking of files with staged changes.
  * Somewhat sped up `git commit` of modifications to unlocked files.
  * Build fix for older ghc.

git-annex (0.20110522) unstable; urgency=low

  * Closer emulation of git's behavior when told to use "foo/.git" as a

  * --backend now overrides any backend configured in .gitattributes files.
  * Add --debug option. Closes: #627499

git-annex (0.20110516) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a few tweaks to make it easy to use the Internet Archive's variant
    of S3. In particular, munge key filenames to comply with the IA's filename
    limits, disable encryption, support their nonstandard way of creating
    buckets, and allow x-archive-* headers to be specified in initremote to
    set item metadata.
  * Added filename extension preserving variant backends SHA1E, SHA256E, etc.
  * migrate: Use current filename when generating new key, for backends
    where the filename affects the key name.
  * Work around a bug in Network.URI's handling of bracketed ipv6 addresses.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 16 May 2011 14:16:52 -0400

git-annex (0.20110503) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix hasKeyCheap setting for bup and rsync special remotes.
  * Add hook special remotes.
  * Avoid crashing when an existing key is readded to the annex.
  * unused: Now also lists files fsck places in .git/annex/bad/
  * S3: When encryption is enabled, the Amazon S3 login credentials
    are stored, encrypted, in .git-annex/remotes.log, so environment
    variables need not be set after the remote is initialized.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 03 May 2011 20:56:01 -0400

git-annex (0.20110427) unstable; urgency=low

  * Switch back to haskell SHA library, so git-annex remains buildable on
    Debian stable.
  * Added rsync special remotes. This could be used, for example, to 
    store annexed content on rsync.net (encrypted naturally). Or anywhere else.
  * Bugfix: Avoid pipeline stall when running git annex drop or fsck on a
    lot of files. Possibly only occured with ghc 7.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 27 Apr 2011 22:50:26 -0400

git-annex (0.20110425) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use haskell Crypto library instead of haskell SHA library.
  * Remove testpack from build depends for non x86 architectures where it
    is not available. The test suite will not be run if it cannot be compiled.
  * Avoid using absolute paths when staging location log, as that can
    confuse git when a remote's path contains a symlink. Closes: #621386

git-annex (0.20110420) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update Debian build dependencies for ghc 7.
  * Debian package is now built with S3 support.
    Thanks Joachim Breitner for making this possible.
  * Somewhat improved memory usage of S3, still work to do.
    Thanks Greg Heartsfield for ongoing work to improve the hS3 library
    for git-annex.

git-annex (0.20110419) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't run gpg in batch mode, so it can prompt for passphrase when
    there is no agent.
  * Add missing build dep on dataenc.
  * S3: Fix stalls when transferring encrypted data.
  * bup: Avoid memory leak when transferring encrypted data.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Apr 2011 21:26:51 -0400

git-annex (0.20110417) unstable; urgency=low

  * bup is now supported as a special type of remote.
  * The data sent to special remotes (Amazon S3, bup, etc) can be encrypted
    using GPG for privacy.
  * Use lowercase hash directories for locationlog files, to avoid
    some issues with git on OSX with the mixed-case directories.
    No migration is needed; the old mixed case hash directories are still
    read; new information is written to the new directories.
  * Unused files on remotes, particulary special remotes, can now be
    identified and dropped, by using "--from remote" with git annex unused
    and git annex dropunused.
  * Clear up short option confusion between --from and --force (-f is now
    --from, and there is no short option for --force).
  * Add build depend on perlmagick so docs are consistently built.
    Closes: #621410
  * Add doc-base file. Closes: #621408
  * Periodically flush git command queue, to avoid boating memory usage
    too much.
  * Support "sha1" and "sha512" commands on FreeBSD, and allow building
    if any/all SHA commands are not available. Thanks, Fraser Tweedale

git-annex (0.20110401) experimental; urgency=low

  * Amazon S3 is now supported as a special type of remote.
    Warning: Encrypting data before sending it to S3 is not yet supported.
  * Note that Amazon S3 support is not built in by default on Debian yet,
    as hS3 is not packaged.
  * fsck: Ensure that files and directories in .git/annex/objects
    have proper permissions.
  * Added a special type of remote called a directory remote, which
    simply stores files in an arbitrary local directory.
  * Bugfix: copy --to --fast never really copied, fixed.

git-annex (0.20110328) experimental; urgency=low

  * annex.diskreserve can be given in arbitrary units (ie "0.5 gigabytes")
  * Generalized remotes handling, laying groundwork for remotes that are
    not regular git remotes. (Think Amazon S3.)
  * Provide a less expensive version of `git annex copy --to`, enabled
    via --fast. This assumes that location tracking information is correct,
    rather than contacting the remote for every file.
  * Bugfix: Keys could be received into v1 annexes from v2 annexes, via
    v1 git-annex-shell. This results in some oddly named keys in the v1
    annex. Recognise and fix those keys when upgrading, instead of crashing.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 28 Mar 2011 10:47:29 -0400

git-annex (0.20110325) experimental; urgency=low

  * Free space checking is now done, for transfers of data for keys
    that have free space metadata. (Notably, not for SHA* keys generated
    with git-annex 0.2x or earlier.) The code is believed to work on
    Linux, FreeBSD, and OSX; check compile-time messages to see if it
    is not enabled for your OS.
  * Add annex.diskreserve config setting, to control how much free space
    to reserve for other purposes and avoid using (defaults to 1 mb).
  * Add --fast flag, that can enable less expensive, but also less thorough
    versions of some commands.
  * fsck: In fast mode, avoid checking checksums.
  * unused: In fast mode, just show all existing temp files as unused,
    and avoid expensive scan for other unused content.
  * migrate: Support migrating v1 SHA keys to v2 SHA keys with
    size information that can be used for free space checking.
  * Fix space leak in fsck and drop commands.
  * migrate: Bugfix for case when migrating a file results in a key that
    is already present in .git/annex/objects.
  * dropunused: Significantly sped up; only read unused log file once.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 25 Mar 2011 00:47:37 -0400

git-annex (0.20110320) experimental; urgency=low

  * Fix dropping of files using the URL backend.
  * Fix support for remotes with '.' in their names.
  * Add version command to show git-annex version as well as repository
    version information.
  * No longer auto-upgrade to repository format 2, to avoid accidental
    upgrades, etc. Use git-annex upgrade when you're ready to run this
    version.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 20 Mar 2011 16:36:33 -0400

git-annex (0.20110316) experimental; urgency=low

  * New repository format, annex.version=2.
  * The first time git-annex is run in an old format repository, it
    will automatically upgrade it to the new format, staging all
    necessary changes to git. Also added a "git annex upgrade" command.
  * Colons are now avoided in filenames, so bare clones of git repos
    can be put on USB thumb drives formatted with vFAT or similar
    filesystems.
  * Added two levels of hashing to object directory and .git-annex logs,
    to improve scalability with enormous numbers of annexed
    objects. (With one hundred million annexed objects, each
    directory would contain fewer than 1024 files.)
  * The setkey, fromkey, and dropkey subcommands have changed how
    the key is specified. --backend is no longer used with these.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 16 Mar 2011 16:20:23 -0400

git-annex (0.24) unstable; urgency=low

  Branched the 0.24 series, which will be maintained for a while to
  support v1 git-annex repos, while main development moves to the 0.2011
  series, with v2 git-annex repos.

  * Add Suggests on graphviz. Closes: #618039
  * When adding files to the annex, the symlinks pointing at the annexed
    content are made to have the same mtime as the original file.
    While git does not preserve that information, this allows a tool
    like metastore to be used with annexed files.
    (Currently this is only done on systems supporting POSIX 200809.)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 16 Mar 2011 18:35:13 -0400

git-annex (0.23) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support ssh remotes with a port specified.
  * whereis: New subcommand to show where a file's content has gotten to.
  * Rethink filename encoding handling for display. Since filename encoding
    may or may not match locale settings, any attempt to decode filenames 
    will fail for some files. So instead, do all output in binary mode.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 12 Mar 2011 15:02:49 -0400

git-annex (0.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Git annexes can now be attached to bare git repositories.
    (Both the local and remote host must have this version of git-annex
    installed for it to work.)
  * Support filenames that start with a dash; when such a file is passed
    to a utility it will be escaped to avoid it being interpreted as an
    option. (I went a little overboard and got the type checker involved
    in this, so such files are rather comprehensively supported now.)
  * New backends: SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224
    (Supported on systems where corresponding shaNsum commands are available.)
  * describe: New subcommand that can set or change the description of
    a repository.
  * Fix test suite to reap zombies.
    (Zombies can be particularly annoying on OSX; thanks to Jimmy Tang
    for his help eliminating the infestation... for now.)
  * Make test suite not rely on a working cp -pr.
    (The Unix wars are still ON!)
  * Look for dir.git directories the same as git does.
  * Support remote urls specified as relative paths.
  * Support non-ssh remote paths that contain tilde expansions.
  * fsck: Check for and repair location log damage.
  * Bugfix: When fsck detected and moved away corrupt file content, it did
    not update the location log.

  * test: Don't rely on chmod -R working.
  * unannex: Fix recently introduced bug when attempting to unannex more
    than one file at a time.
  * test: Set git user name and email in case git can't guess values.
  * Fix display of unicode filenames.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 11 Feb 2011 23:21:08 -0400

git-annex (0.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Preserve specified file ordering when instructed to act on multiple
    files or directories. For example, "git annex get a b" will now always
    get "a" before "b". Previously it could operate in either order.
  * unannex: Commit staged changes at end, to avoid some confusing behavior
    with the pre-commit hook, which would see some types of commits after
    an unannex as checking in of an unlocked file.
  * map: New subcommand that uses graphviz to display a nice map of
    the git repository network.
  * Deal with the mtl/monads-fd conflict.
  * configure: Check for sha1sum.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 08 Feb 2011 18:57:24 -0400

git-annex (0.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * configure: Support using the uuidgen command if the uuid command is
    not available.
  * Allow --exclude to be specified more than once.
  * There are now three levels of repository trust.
  * untrust: Now marks the current repository as untrusted.
  * semitrust: Now restores the default trust level. (What untrust used to do.)
  * fsck, drop: Take untrusted repositories into account.
  * Bugfix: Files were copied from trusted remotes first even if their
    annex.cost was higher than other remotes.
  * Improved temp file handling. Transfers of content can now be resumed
    from temp files later; the resume does not have to be the immediate
    next git-annex run.
  * unused: Include partially transferred content in the list.
  * Bugfix: Running a second git-annex while a first has a transfer in
    progress no longer deletes the first processes's temp file.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 28 Jan 2011 14:31:37 -0400

git-annex (0.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bugfix: `copy --to` and `move --to` forgot to stage location log changes
    after transferring the file to the remote repository.
    (Did not affect ssh remotes.)
  * fsck: Fix bug in moving of corrupted files to .git/annex/bad/
  * migrate: Fix support for --backend option.
  * unlock: Fix behavior when file content is not present.
  * Test suite improvements. Current top-level test coverage: 80%

git-annex (0.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * unannex: Now skips files whose content is not present, rather than
    it being an error.
  * New migrate subcommand can be used to switch files to using a different
    backend, safely and with no duplication of content.
  * bugfix: Fix crash caused by empty key name. (Thanks Henrik for reporting.)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 09 Jan 2011 10:04:11 -0400

git-annex (0.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * git-annex-shell: Avoid exposing any git repo config except for the
    annex.uuid when doing configlist.
  * bugfix: Running `move --to` with a remote whose UUID was not yet known
    could result in git-annex not recording on the local side where the
    file was moved to. This could not result in data loss, or even a
    significant problem, since the remote *did* record that it had the file.
  * Also, add a general guard to detect attempts to record information
    about repositories with missing UUIDs.
  * bugfix: Running `move --to` with a non-ssh remote failed.
  * bugfix: Running `copy --to` with a non-ssh remote actually did a move.
  * Many test suite improvements. Current top-level test coverage: 65%

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 07 Jan 2011 14:33:13 -0400

git-annex (0.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support scp-style urls for remotes (host:path).
  * Support ssh urls containing "~".
  * Add trust and untrust subcommands, to allow configuring repositories
    that are trusted to retain files without explicit checking.
  * Fix bug in numcopies handling when multiple remotes pointed to the
    same repository.
  * Introduce the git-annex-shell command. It's now possible to make
    a user have it as a restricted login shell, similar to git-shell.
  * Note that git-annex will always use git-annex-shell when accessing
    a ssh remote, so all of your remotes need to be upgraded to this
    version of git-annex at the same time.
  * Now rsync is exclusively used for copying files to and from remotes.
    scp is not longer supported.

git-annex (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * In .gitattributes, the annex.numcopies attribute can be used
    to control the number of copies to retain of different types of files.
  * Bugfix: Always correctly handle gitattributes when in a subdirectory of

    ones like "dir/*".)
  * fsck: Fix warning about not enough copies of a file, when locations
    are known, but are not available in currently configured remotes.
  * precommit: Optimise to avoid calling git-check-attr more than once.
  * The git-annex-backend attribute has been renamed to annex.backend.

git-annex (0.09) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add copy subcommand.
  * Fix bug in setkey subcommand triggered by move --to.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 27 Nov 2010 17:14:59 -0400

git-annex (0.08) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix `git annex add ../foo` (when ran in a subdir of the repo).
  * Add configure step to build process.
  * Only use cp -a if it is supported, falling back to cp -p or plain cp
    as needed for portability.
  * cp --reflink=auto is used if supported, and will make git annex unlock
    much faster on filesystems like btrfs that support copy on write.

git-annex (0.07) unstable; urgency=low

  * find: New subcommand.
  * unused: New subcommand, finds unused data. (Split out from fsck.)
  * dropunused: New subcommand, provides for easy dropping of unused keys
    by number, as listed by the unused subcommand.
  * fsck: Print warnings to stderr; --quiet can now be used to only see
    problems.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 15 Nov 2010 18:41:50 -0400

git-annex (0.06) unstable; urgency=low

  * fsck: Check if annex.numcopies is satisfied.
  * fsck: Verify the sha1 of files when the SHA1 backend is used.
  * fsck: Verify the size of files when the WORM backend is used.
  * fsck: Allow specifying individual files if fscking everything
    is not desired.
  * fsck: Fix bug, introduced in 0.04, in detection of unused data.

git-annex (0.05) unstable; urgency=low

  * Optimize both pre-commit and lock subcommands to not call git diff
    on every file being committed/locked.
    (This actually also works around a bug in ghc, that caused
    git-annex 0.04 pre-commit to sometimes corrupt filename being read
    from git ls-files and fail. 
    See <http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/4493>
    The excessive number of calls made by pre-commit exposed the ghc bug.
    Thanks Josh Triplett for the debugging.)
  * Build with -O2.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 11 Nov 2010 18:31:09 -0400

git-annex (0.04) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add unlock subcommand, which replaces the symlink with a copy of
    the file's content in preparation of changing it. The "edit" subcommand
    is an alias for unlock.
  * Add lock subcommand.
  * Unlocked files will now automatically be added back into the annex when
    committed (and the updated symlink committed), by some magic in the
    pre-commit hook.
  * The SHA1 backend is now fully usable.
  * Add annex.version, which will be used to automate upgrades
    between incompatible versions.
  * Reorganised the layout of .git/annex/
  * The new layout will be automatically upgraded to the first time
    git-annex is used in a repository with the old layout.
  * Note that git-annex 0.04 cannot transfer content from old repositories
    that have not yet been upgraded.
  * Annexed file contents are now made unwritable and put in unwriteable
    directories, to avoid them accidentially being removed or modified.
    (Thanks Josh Triplett for the idea.)
  * Add build dep on libghc6-testpack-dev. Closes: #603016
  * Avoid using runghc to run test suite as it is not available on all
    architectures. Closes: #603006

git-annex (0.03) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix support for file:// remotes.
  * Add --verbose
  * Fix SIGINT handling.
  * Fix handling of files with unusual characters in their name.
  * Fixed memory leak; git-annex no longer reads the whole file list
    from git before starting, and will be much faster with large repos.
  * Fix crash on unknown symlinks.
  * Added remote.annex-scp-options and remote.annex-ssh-options.
  * The backends to use when adding different sets of files can be configured
    via gitattributes.
  * In .gitattributes, the git-annex-backend attribute can be set to the
    names of backends to use when adding different types of files.
  * Add fsck subcommand. (For now it only finds unused key contents in the
    annex.)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 07 Nov 2010 18:26:04 -0400

git-annex (0.02) unstable; urgency=low

  * Can scp annexed files from remote hosts, and check remote hosts for
    file content when dropping files.
  * New move subcommand, that makes it easy to move file contents from
    or to a remote.
  * New fromkey subcommand, for registering urls, etc.
  * git-annex init will now set up a pre-commit hook that fixes up symlinks
    before they are committed, to ensure that moving symlinks around does not
    break them.
  * More intelligent and fast staging of modified files; git add coalescing.
  * Add remote.annex-ignore git config setting to allow completly disabling
    a given remote.
  * --from/--to can be used to control the remote repository that git-annex
    uses.
  * --quiet can be used to avoid verbose output
  * New plumbing-level dropkey and addkey subcommands.
  * Lots of bug fixes.
